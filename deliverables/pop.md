# Project Overview Proposal

## Project C.H.I.M.E.R.A - Cryptic Haunting Investigation and Mysterious Entity Research Application

* Objective
  * WSU students, faculty, and staff have reported strange disturbances across the campus and surrounding areas. Campus police, maintnence, and custodial staffâ€™s investigations have all turned up inconclusive information regarding these disturbances. We believe these disturbances are of the supernatural nature. The goal of C.H.I.M.E.R.A. is to compile all known supernatural entity data and compare reports from students to help determine unknown supernatural entities.
* Project Components
  * Administrator/Moderator Portal - An administrative portal built in unison with the front end to allow moderators/admins to manually adjust reports and entity data.
  * Back End - A back end to help route data pulled from databases to place into comparitive tools as well provide data to the front end to allow users to search across records.
  * Comparitive Analysis Tools - The tools that will compare user reports against known entity data, identify patterns of new reports, and comparing user submitted reports with historical data.
  * Databases - A database that contains all known information regarding the supernatural entities and User inputted reports.
  * Front End - A front end to view the known entity information, the user inputted reports, and to submit new user report to be compiled and compared against.
* Predicted Architecture
    * Prompt: "We think, based on not touching it yet, we'll do..." - TBD
* Languages and Frameworks
    * Include a response to: "why are you picking the tech stack that you are?" - TBD
* Predicted life cycle/methodology
    * Sprint/Scrum - TBD
